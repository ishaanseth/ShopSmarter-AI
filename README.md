# ShopSmarter: AI Personal Shopper

Welcome to ShopSmarter AI! This application is an intelligent personal shopping assistant designed to help you discover products based on visual inspiration. Upload an image, and our AI will analyze it to suggest similar items and complementary products. You can then chat with the AI to refine your search, ask for alternatives, or get style advice.

**(Note: This project is currently in development. Features and functionality are actively being enhanced.)**

## What it Does

ShopSmarter leverages the power of Google's Gemini AI to provide a unique shopping experience:

1.  **Image Upload**: Start by uploading an image of an item or style you like.
2.  **AI Analysis**: The AI analyzes the visual features of the uploaded image.
3.  **Product Suggestions**: Based on the analysis, you'll receive suggestions for:
    *   **Similar Products**: Items that closely match the one in your image.
    *   **Complementary Products**: Items that would go well with the main item.
4.  **Interactive Chat**: Refine your search by chatting with the ShopSmarter AI. Ask for variations, different colors, price ranges, or specific types of complementary items.
5.  **Simulated Checkout**: A conceptual checkout process to mimic a complete shopping flow (no real transactions).

## Setup and Running

To run ShopSmarter AI locally, follow these steps:

1.  **Prerequisites**:
    *   A modern web browser that supports ES6 modules.
    *   A local HTTP server to serve the `index.html` file. Common options include:
        *   Node.js: `npx serve .` (run from the project root directory)
        *   Python 3: `python3 -m http.server` or `python -m http.server` (run from the project root directory)
        *   Using a VS Code extension like "Live Server".

2.  **Get a Google Gemini API Key**:
    *   You'll need an API key for Google's Gemini API. You can obtain one from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).

3.  **Set Up Environment Variable**:
    *   The application requires the Gemini API key to be available as an environment variable named `API_KEY`.
    *   **Before starting your local HTTP server**, set this environment variable in your terminal session:
        *   On macOS/Linux:
            ```bash
            export API_KEY="YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE"
            ```
        *   On Windows (Command Prompt):
            ```bash
            set API_KEY="YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE"
            ```
        *   On Windows (PowerShell):
            ```powershell
            $env:API_KEY="YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE"
            ```
    *   **Important**: Replace `"YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE"` with your actual API key.
    *   The application code (`geminiService.ts`) directly attempts to read `process.env.API_KEY`. Your local development environment or server must make this variable accessible to the JavaScript context where the Gemini API client is initialized. If you are using a simple static file server that only serves files without processing them, this method of accessing environment variables (`process.env.API_KEY`) will not work directly in client-side JavaScript. This setup assumes an environment where `process.env.API_KEY` is made available to the JavaScript runtime (e.g., through a build process or a server-side templating mechanism, which are not part of the current simple file structure).

4.  **Serve the Application**:
    *   Navigate to the project's root directory in your terminal.
    *   Start your chosen HTTP server. For example, using `npx serve`:
        ```bash
        npx serve .
        ```
    *   The server will typically output a local URL (e.g., `http://localhost:3000`, `http://localhost:5000` or `http://localhost:8000`).

5.  **Open in Browser**:
    *   Open the provided local URL in your web browser to use ShopSmarter AI.
